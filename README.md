# monitor-and-control-system-for-a-small-installation
In this project, a system is designed to monitor the room temperature and control the light intensity. To measure the temperature, a digital humidity and temperature sensor is used and, in the case of light intensity, a photoresistor is adopted. A LCD module, equipped with a Inter-Integrated Circuit interface, is used to display these two measurements. The source of light is generated by a LED. All these components are connected to an Arduino microcontroller, where a software application, written in C, filters and normalises the measured data based on the 10 bit analogue converters and 8 bit digital ones. Moreover, to control the light intensity, the process is identified as a first order transfer function and a control algorithm is developed to track the reference, given by a potentiometer.
